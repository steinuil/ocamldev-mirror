(*s Maps over integers implemented as Patricia trees.
    The following signature is exactly [Map.S with type key = int],
    with the same specifications. *)

type key = int

val empty : 'a t

val add : int -> 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t

val find : int -> 'a t -> 'a

val remove : int -> 'a t -> 'a t

val mem :  int -> 'a t -> bool

val iter : (int -> 'a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit

val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t

val mapi : (int -> 'a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t

val fold : (int -> 'a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b -> 'b
